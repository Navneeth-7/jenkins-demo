Configure SSH on the Remote Agent:-

Log into the master via SSH. From the master node, use SSH to log into the worker node.

On the worker node, create the directory for the user's home:

sudo mkdir /var/lib/jenkins
Add the user, assigning the home directory:

sudo useradd -d /var/lib/jenkins jenkins
Make the user the owner of their home directory:

sudo chown -R jenkins:jenkins /var/lib/jenkins
Create an .ssh directory for the jenkins user:

sudo mkdir /var/lib/jenkins/.ssh
Run ssh-keygen. Hit Enter to accept defaults until it completes.

Copy the contents of ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub to the file /var/lib/jenkins/.ssh/authorized_keys

cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub # Copy the output

sudo vi /var/lib/jenkins/.ssh/authorized_keys # Paste the output of cat and save
Copy the contents of id_rsa, as this is the private key that we will paste into Jenkins.

Exit the worker node.

Create an .ssh directory on the master in the jenkins directory:

sudo mkdir /var/lib/jenkins/.ssh
Copy the known_hosts entry over from the /home/cloud_user/.ssh directory to the jenkins user's .ssh:

sudo cp ~/.ssh/known_hosts /var/lib/jenkins/.ssh	

	
	
	

Set up the Node on the Jenkins Master:-	
	
Log into the Jenkins master web interface at port :8080 using credentials:

In the Jenkins master, go to Manage Jenkins and select Manage Nodes and Clouds.

On this page, add a node.

Name the node worker1.

On the Remote root directory line, type /var/lib/jenkins.

Set the number of executors to 2.

On the Host line enter the IP address of the worker

On the Credentials line click Add.

In the credentials configuration page, set the type to SSH Username with private key.

Enter the username jenkins.

Enter the contents of the id_rsa as the key.

Set the description to jssh.

Save.

Select the credential you just created as the SSH credential.

Save.

Go to the worker node logs and ensure that the worker node is set up correctly.




Test a Remote Build:- 

Configure the master to use labels, to ensure default builds run on the remote:

On the master node, on the left go to Manage Jenkins.
Select Configure System.
On the Labels line, enter master.
Set Usage to Only build jobs with label expressions matching this node.
Save.
Create a Freestyle project.

Create a build step that runs a shell command.

Enter:

hostname > location.txt
Create a post build step that archives the *.txt files.

Run the build.

Check the log to ensure that the build ran on the remote agent.

Check the artifact to ensure that it contains the hostname of the remote worker.
